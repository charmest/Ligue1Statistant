Ligue1Statistant is my biggest personal project so far !

I'm working on it since before I was a web developper.

The goal is to get for each game of the french football Ligue 1 a complete stats report 
with detailed unique stats and a result probability.

This app uses a JavaFX interface and generates Microsoft Word format reports.

It's not available yet but it's in constant evolution. 

Everything is in Java but I intend to add new technologies to this project.
